### Hello 
To run this python program, assuming you have pip and python, you need to run this in a command terminal to first get the dependencies:
```
pip install networkx matplotlib
```
After that in the folder of `sdn.py` and this `readme.md` just run this:
 ```
 ./sdn.py
 ```
 Once the program starts you wil be able to type into the CLI. Type "help" to see a list of commands that you can use. THANKS!
